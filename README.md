# My-Teaching

At Dream School Foundation, I had the privilege of serving as a Volunteer Teacher, contributing to the educational journey of approximately 150-200 undergraduate students spread across 10 batches. Under the dynamic leadership of Program Manager Sharmeela Prakasham, I played a crucial role in imparting knowledge and fostering a passion for learning.
